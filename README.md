# Final_Project
I acted as a Security Engineer to investigate the discrepancies within the Kibana alerting system. 
By creating new alerts to monitor life traffics, on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
This was achieved by attacking a vulenerable VM within the network.
The following tools were used; Nmap, John The Ripper, MySQL, SSH, Wireshark.
Reports from the findings are; 
 * Defensive Report (Blue Team)
 * Offensive Report (Red Team)
 * Network Analysis
